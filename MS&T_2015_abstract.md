#Compact Process-Structure Evolutions using Spectral Representations in Materials Knowledge Systems Framework

The materials and processing design space is an unimaginably large parameter space. Conventional approaches used to
iteratively explore this space through experiments and simulations are both monetarily and computationally expensive. 
Cheap and accurate meta-models are needed to explore the space quickly. In this talk the Materials Knowledge Systems
framework with a spectral representation of the local state space will be presented as a viable approach to generating
these meta-models.
