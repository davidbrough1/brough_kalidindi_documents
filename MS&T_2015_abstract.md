#PyMKS - Materials Knowledge Systems in Python

Community development of a materials data analytics toolset can 
significantly change the landscape of the emerging cross-disciplinary 
field of Materials Informatics and address the critical needs outlined 
in MGI and ICME. The Materials Knowledge Systems provides viable approach 
to efficiently explore the unimaginably large parameter space that is 
materials and processing design through the generation of meta-models 
and Materials Informatics. 

Materials Knowledge Systems in Python (PyMKS) aims to seed and nurture 
an emergent user group in the materials data analytics for establishing 
homogenization and localization linkages. PyMKS provides high level 
access to the Materials Knowledge Systems framework through APIs and 
leverages open source scientific and machine learning packages in 
Python. An overview of the PyMKS project as well as examples will be 
presented.
