#PyMKS - Materials Knowledge Systems in Python

Community development of a materials data analytics toolset can significantly change the landscape of the emerging cross-disciplinary field of Materials Informatics and address the critical needs outlined in MGI and ICME. The Materials Knowledge Systems framework provides a viable approach to efficiently explore the unimaginably large parameter space that is materials and processing design through the generation of efficient meta-models. Materials Knowledge Systems in Python (PyMKS) aims to seed and nurture an emergent user group in the materials data analytics for establishing homogenization and localization linkages. PyMKS provides high level access to the Materials Knowledge Systems framework through simple APIs and leverages open source scientific computing and machine learning packages in Python. An overview of the PyMKS project as well as examples using this flexible tool for Materials Informatics will be presented.
