#PyMKS - Materials Knowledge Systems in Python

Community development of materials data analytics toolsets can dramatically alter the landscape of the existing materials innovation ecosystem, and transform the vision outlined in the MGI and ICME documents into reality. The Materials Knowledge Systems framework provides a viable approach for efficient exploration of the unimaginably large materials and process (i.e. manufacturing) design space through the development and implementation of efficient meta-models. Materials Knowledge Systems in Python (PyMKS) aims to seed and nurture an emergent materials analytics user group focused on homogenization and localization linkages central to virtually all multiscale materials modeling efforts. PyMKS provides high level access to the Materials Knowledge Systems framework through simple APIs and leverages open source scientific computing and machine learning packages in Python. An overview of the PyMKS project as well as examples using this Materials Informatics tool will be presented.
