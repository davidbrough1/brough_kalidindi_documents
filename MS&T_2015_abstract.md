#PyMKS - Materials Knowledge Systems in Python

Community development of a materials data analytics toolset can 
significantly change the landscape of the emerging cross-disciplinary 
field of Materials Informatics and address the critical needs outlined 
in MGI and ICME. The Materials Knowledge Systems provides viable approach 
to efficiently explore the unimaginably large parameter space that is 
materials and processing design through the generation of meta-models 
and Materials Informatics. 

Materials Knowledge Systems in Python (PyMKS) aims to seed and nurture 
an emergent user group in the materials data analytics for establishing 
homogenization and localization linkages by leveraging open source 
scientific and machine learning packages in Python as well as provides 
high level APIs that give easy access to the Materials Knowledge Systems 
framework. An overview of the PyMKS project as well as examples will
be presented.
